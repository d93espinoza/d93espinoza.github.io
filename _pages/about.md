Hi! I am a 3rd year MD-PhD candidate in the laboratory of Amit Bar-Or, MD at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. I am currently a memeber of the Immunology Graduate Group, and my interests lie in investigating multiple sclerosis and the immune system both through leveraging and developing systems biology approaches.
